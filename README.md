# COVID-19-Main-Protease-Bioinformatics-Research-Project
Independent research using BioPython and PyMOL to research COVID-19 main protease (Mpro), and how COVID-19 Mpro (6LU7) versus Omicron P132H Mpro (7TLL) can alter predicted binding of natural metabolites (not FDA approved). I want to research if there are any ligands that bind effectively across these two COVID variants.
