# COVID-Main-Protease-Bioinformatics-Research-Project
Independent research project using Python, BioPython, Modeller, AutoDock Vina, and ChimeraX to research COVID main protease (Mpro), and how COVID-19 Mpro (6LU7) versus Omicron P132H Mpro (7TLL) can alter predicted binding of natural metabolites (not FDA approved). I want to research if there are any ligands that bind effectively across these two COVID variants, and how the P132H mutation effects the Omicron Mpro. I cleaned the protein data and then ran BLAST on the proteins, allowing us to see that there is a lack of evolutionary and structural impact from the mutation, suggesting the mutation only effects protein dynamics. The RMSD, RMSF, and Z-score analysis further confirmed this, as there were no large structural differences in the polypeptide chain besides in areas where there was high flexibility due to a lack of rigid structures such as beta sheets and alpha helices. I plan to use AutoDock Vina to see the molecular interactions with ligands and how they effect the binding affinities of the ligands. I will also use ChimeraX and a Jupyter Notebook to show the results of this research project.
